DBMS Lab 1: Database Design: COVID-19 Tracking Information System

 

Design the E-R diagram to capture the logical data organization for the 
COVID-19 tracking system described below. Convert the E-R diagram to 
relational tables.

Upload a pdf file with the E-R diagram and the table definitions to 
moodle. Credits will be given based on the richness of the design and the 
number of functionalities that may be supported.

 

System Description:

A large-scale pandemic creates confusions and leads to spread of rumours. 
We would like to build an information system where a user can access 
verified information about the pandemic. We obtain data from the following 
sources:

1.       Hospitalizations: including patient information including 
location, symptoms, treatments involved, and healthcare resources used.

2.       Self-reporting from affected citizens

3.       Testing labs

4.       Vaccination centres

5.       Social media

The system is supposed to cater to the information need of following 
users.

1.       A. Citizens: for information gathering about various facets of 
the pandemic

2.      B. Healthcare professionals: for patient profile, disease and 
symptom tracking

3.       C. Government agencies: for resource mobilization and 
infrastructure readiness

Various features of the system include â€“ i. reporting the prevalence and 
progress of pandemic with time, among various patient profiles, 
geographical units like districts and states, ii. tracking symptoms and 
variants that are currently common, iii. use of healthcare resources and 
inventory management for future readiness, iii. contact tracing, iv. any 
other functionality that you want to support.
